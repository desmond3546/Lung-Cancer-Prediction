This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of lung cancer based on a dataset containing various health-related and lifestyle features. 
Key attributes include gender, age, smoking habits, chronic disease history, fatigue, and other symptoms like coughing, wheezing, and chest pain.
The dataset is preprocessed to clean and prepare the data, and various classification models are evaluated to identify the best-performing algorithm. 
The goal is to develop a reliable tool that can assist healthcare professionals in early detection and intervention for lung cancer.
